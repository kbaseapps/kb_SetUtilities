    <p><b>Merge Genome Sets</b> allows a user to combine multiple GenomeSet objects into a single GenomeSet object. This may be useful in scenarios where genomes are identified as being of interest from multiple approaches, and the user wishes to perform follow up investigation of all the genomes together.</p>

    <p><h3>Notes</h3></p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>If sets have overlapping genomes, the genomes will be duplicated in the resulting set. Use the built-in viewer to edit the set to remove duplicates. This can be done by simply clicking on the Set name in the Data Panel.</li>
        <li>If you need to add individual genomes to your Genome Set, please use the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/kb_SetUtilities/KButil_Build_GenomeSet/release”>Build GenomeSet</a> App.</li>
      </ul.
