    <p><b>Merge Feature Sets</b> allows a user to combine multiple input FeatureSets into a single FeatureSet object. This may be useful in scenarios where features are identified as being of interest from multiple approaches, and the user wishes to perform follow up investigation of all the features together. For example, if running the <i>Find Candidate Genes for a Reaction</i> App to generate multiple sets of gene candidates, these sets can be combined for analysis in the <i>Homolog Genome Context</i>.</p>
