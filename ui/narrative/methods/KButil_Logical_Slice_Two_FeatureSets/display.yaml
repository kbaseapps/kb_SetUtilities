    <p>This App allows users to create an intersection set or difference set from two <b><i>Feature Sets</i></b>, A and B, ie, a new <b><i>FeatureSet</i></b> containing only features that correspond to present in {A and B}, or {A and (not B)}, or {(not A) and B}.</p>

    <p><b>Running the App:</b> <i>Note that in this App, all inputs are required or mandatory.</i> The first two inputs are sets of genome features (FeatureSets), which may have been created by any of several Apps in KBase, such as Build Feature Set from Genome, BLASTp prot-prot Search, Merge FeatureSets, Slice FeatureSets by Genomes, among others.</p>

    <p>This is followed by a pull-down menu for “Logical slice” which indicates which set (Venn diagram) operation to perform:
      <ul>
        <li>Features found in both A and B (set intersection)</li>
        <li>Features found in A but not B  (set difference, A - B)</li>
        <li>Features found in B but not A  (set difference, B - A)</li>
      </ul>
    <p>

    <p>Below that is a text entry field for a meaningful description of the resultant set, followed by the name to be given to the resultant <b>FeatureSet</b> object. Upon successful completion, a new <b>FeatureSet</b> object with the given name will appear in the Data Pane, and a short report listing the description and number of features in this set will appear below the App cell window in the Narrative.</p>
