    <p><b>Merge ReadsSets</b> allows a user to combine multiple ReadsSet into a single ReadsSet. This facilitates batch processing of data. For example, all the reads in the resulting large ReadsSet can be trimmed at once by running the "Trim Reads with Trimmomatic" App on it.  ReadsSets to be merged should all contain either Paired End Libraries or Single End Libraries, but you cannot mix both types of libraries into a single ReadsSet.</p>
