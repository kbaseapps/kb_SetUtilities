description : |
    <p><b>Add Genomes to GenomeSet</b> allows a user to expand the membership of a set of genomes (each of which is a set of DNA contigs including structural and functional annotations). The GenomeSet object can be used in subsequent Apps allowing for bulk operations on Genome objects. The Genomes and GenomeSet must already be within the Narrative's data workspace, so if there are genomes from other Narratives or public reference genomes that the user wishes to include, they must first be imported into the active Narrative. Simply click the <b>”+”</b> plus icon to add a Genome object to the set. Once the plus icon is selected, a dropdown list will appear that is populated with all the Genome objects in the narrative.  Additionally, you may add the genomes present in GenomeSets and Species Trees here.</p>

    <p>The result tab of this App displays the name of the created GenomeSet object. It also displays the number of the Genome objects in this set. To see the component assembly object names, go to the “View Configure” tab within the App.</p>
