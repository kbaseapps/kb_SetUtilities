    <p>This App allows the user to group individual <b><i>Assembly</i></b> objects into an <b><i>Assembly Set</i></b>.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <b>Batch Create Assembly Set</b> allows a user to create a Set of Assemblies (each one of which is a group of contigs or scaffold genome fragments) which can be used in subsequent Apps that operate on Assembly Sets.  Each Assembly object must already be within the Narrative's data workspace, so if there are assemblies from other Narratives or assemblies from public reference genomes that the user wishes to include, they must first be imported into the active Narrative.  All Assemblies that match the <i>Name Pattern</i> will be included in the Set.  If the <i>Name Pattern</i> is left blank, all assembly objects in the current Narrative will be included.
    </p>
    <p>Example allowed <i>Name Patterns</i>:<br>
    <ul>
    <li> <b>*.Assembly</b>
    <li> <b>Sample_1-*</b>
    <li> <b>Sample_1-*.Assembly</b>
    </ul>
    </p>
